- How many collisions occur during a given time of day?
- Streets with Highest Frequency of Incidents by Victim Type.

#### Key Findings:

- We can observe that the most number of injuries took place at Brownell Street I.E 18 using 2d Map of Vehicle Collisions by Number of Injuries.
- Using Histogram, we found that most of the vehicle collisions take place between 2 pm to 5 pm, and the least between 2 am to 5 am.
- Broadway Street is a dangerous street which tops the list for both pedestrians and cyclists. Belt Parkway tops when it comes to Motorists with a total of 967 injuries and 4 fatalities.
